            <h2>Theoretical Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Huffman Coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. The primary goal of Huffman Coding is to reduce the total number of bits required to represent a set of characters based on their frequencies.

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.</li>
                <li>Create a leaf node for each character and build a priority queue (min-heap) based on frequency.</li>
                <li>Extract the two nodes with the smallest frequency from the queue.</li>
                <li>Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children and with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes.</li>
                <li>Insert the new node back into the priority queue.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue contains only one node, which becomes the root of the Huffman Tree.</li>
                <li>Assign binary codes to each character by traversing the tree from the root to the leaves, assigning '0' for left branches and '1' for right branches.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimal for prefix codes: No code is a prefix of another.</li>
                <li>Greedy algorithm: Builds the optimal tree in a bottom-up manner.</li>
                <li>Efficiency: Particularly effective when character frequencies vary significantly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Space Complexity</h3>
            <p>The space complexity of Huffman Coding is O(n), where n is the number of unique characters. This space is used to store the frequency table and the Huffman tree.</p>
            <h3>Detailed Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                The primary operations that determine the time complexity of Huffman Coding are the creation and manipulation of the priority queue (min-heap). Building the initial heap takes O(n) time. Each extraction of the two smallest elements and the insertion of their combined node takes O(log n) time, and since there are n-1 such operations, the total time complexity becomes O(n log n). This holds true for the best, average, and worst cases.
